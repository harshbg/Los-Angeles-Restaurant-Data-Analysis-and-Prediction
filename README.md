## Features
We have tried to answer the following questions in our analysis:

* What are the key factors in predicting health “scores” of the restaurants in Los Angeles county?
* What are the most important factors in classifying restaurants into different “grades”?
* Are there any relationships between various types of health code violations and scores/grades of a restaurant?
* Are there any patterns in terms of how health scores of restaurants change over time?
